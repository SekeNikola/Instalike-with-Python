Difference between this Instagram bot and others is that it use to logging in to Your Instagram Account, if you have two-step verification, can be bypassed by logging in with Facebook.

Its also remove popup for turning on notifications.

You can place what hashtags you want to be searched for and the application will choose a random hashtag and start liking photos. Its set to like 200 photos per hour because we wont to get banned from Instagram.

If you like to try it you have to install Selenium and whatever webdriver you want.
